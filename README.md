# CloudFormation Templates

This folder contains a collection of CloudFormation templates for creating various AWS infrastructure resources.


## Usage
To use one of the templates, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console in the region you want to create the resources in.
2. Click on the "Create Stack" button.
3. Select "Upload a template to Amazon S3" and choose the desired CloudFormation template.
4. Follow the instructions in the template to provide any necessary parameters.
5. Click on the "Create" button to create the resources.

## Notes
Each template has its own parameters, resources, and usage instructions, so be sure to read the comments in the code and the corresponding documentation before using it.
Before creating a stack, it is a good idea to review the changes that will be made to your AWS environment by using the "Preview changes" option.
Some of the templates may make changes to IAM roles or policies, so be cautious when using these templates in production environments.
